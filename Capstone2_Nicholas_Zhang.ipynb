        "## **I. Project Motivation**\n",
        "*   E-commerce platforms rely heavily on customer reviews to build trust and improve sales\n",
        "*   Manual review analysis does not scale\n",
        "*   Just looking at ratings hides nuances of reviews (same rating but with different sentiment)\n",
        "*   Businesses want automated insights from reviews\n",
        "\n",
        "## **II. Project Objectives**\n",
        "*   Understanding product sentiment based on customer reviews using NLP\n",
        "*   Predicting product ratings based on review content using ML models\n",
        "*   Summarizing customer reviews to provide concise insights for buyers\n",
        "*   Use deep learning to identify review patterns to detect anomalies in ratings or sentiment trends\n",
        "*   Create an interactive summarization tool for users\n",
        "\n",

        "*   The dataset has 1,465 product reviews with different product categories, prices, rating, and customer feedback\n",
        "*   The structured data will be used for statistical analysis, feature engineering, and modeling\n",
        "*   The unstructured data will be used for NLP tasks like sentiment analysis and summarization\n",

I already has a Micro USB cable from Ambrane and it's still in good shape. I connected my phone to the car using the cable and it got connected well and no issues. I also connected it to the charging port and yes it has Fast Charging support.,It quality is good at this price and the main thing is that i didn't ever thought that this cable will be so long it's good one and charging power is too good and also supports fast charging,Value for money, with extra length👍,Good, working fine,Product quality is good,Good,very good,Bought for my daughter's old phone.Brand new cable it was not charging, I already repacked and requested for replacement.I checked again, and there was some green colour paste/fungus inside the micro USB connector. I cleaned with an alcoholic and starts working again.Checked the ampere of charging speed got around 1400ma-1500ma - not bad, came with braided 1.5m long cable, pretty impressive for the price.Can't blame the manufacturer.But quality issues by the distributor, they might have stored in very humid place.\n",
